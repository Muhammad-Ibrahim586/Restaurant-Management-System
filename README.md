# Restaurant Management System

# Overview
A command-line-based application developed in C++ to manage restaurant operations. This project demonstrates the use of flow control structures, arrays, and functions to build an efficient and interactive system.

# Features

1) User-friendly command-line interface.
2) Efficient management of restaurant operations.
3) Implementation of advanced programming techniques:
   1) Repetition and flow control structures.
   2) Arrays for data management.
   3) Modular design with functions.

# Technologies Used

**Programming Language:** C++
**Development Environment:** Dev_C++ 5.11

# How to Run

1) Clone the repository to your local machine.
2) Compile the source code using any C++ compiler.
3) Run the compiled file to start the application.

# Usage

1) Follow the prompts in the command-line interface.
2) Manage orders, calculate bills, and streamline restaurant operations effectively.

# Future Improvements

1) Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user experience.
2) Extend functionality for inventory and employee management.
3) Integrate database support for persistent data storage.
